# forked-projects
list of forked projects from one of our projects

Rules for having your fork listed here:          

- Your project needs to be an independent initiative and have its own repository as a project.
- Your code needs to be updated to remove our name, images, servers, acronyms, network ID, etc.;
In such a way that your responsibility for the project is clear and does not link our name and/or image to it.
- The project must be active, abandoned projects or removed forks will be removed;
- A contact person for the person responsible needs to be linked to the project, because we will not link obscure projects on our list.
